This is a webpage designed so as to enable users to upload files and create directories.

In this project, users will be able to upload files and download them whenever they require. Also, directories can be created by the users where they can subsequently upload files.

A user must register his profile. During the time of registration a unique directory is created where the user files are stored and also where the user directories created are stored.

The files that are uploaded by the users are first stored in a directory name Temp_Files which is then subsequently moved to the directory specified for that user.
